    excerpt: "If you are palette-challenged, like me, then Coolors.co is the place to go.  It's a suite of tools that helps you to create colour palettes that are professional and balanced.  I use the Palette Generator a lot.  Bring up the page and hit the space-bar until a colour pops up that you like.  Lock it in, and then hit the space-bar again.  Rinse and repeat until you have a 5 colour palette that you like."

# Java and JavaFX

Here's a few obvious links that have the "go to" documentation for Java, Kotlin and JavaFX

- [JavaDocs (Java 16)](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/index.html){:target="_blank"}
- [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/index.html){:target="_blank"}
- [JavaFX CSS Reference](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html){:target="_blank"}

# Jekyll

This website is running in Jekyll on GitHub Pages using the MinimalMistakes theme.  It's a great platform for creating static websites with ongoing content additions.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [MinimalMistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/){:target="_blank"} is the theme that this website uses.  It consolidates a lot of the look and feel and allows for a lot more customization than the default "Minima" theme.
- [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/){:target="_blank"} is the templating language used by Jekyll.
- [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} is the markdown language used by Jekyll (actually it's the parser, but let's not split hairs)
- [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) I used to use Atom, but it's dead now.  I tried VS Code, but hated it.  Pulsar is a fork of Atom that's still in development and it seems good.

# Libraries

These are Java Libraries that I use all the time:

- [Ikonli](https://kordamp.org/ikonli/){:target="_blank"}
 has the "glue" that allows you to integrate FontAwesome icons into JavaFX screens as Nodes.  It's well worth looking into as FontAwesome opens up a world of easy to use, clean icons with the ability to set the colours.
