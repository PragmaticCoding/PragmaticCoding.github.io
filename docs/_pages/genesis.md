In the Beginning the Project Manager created the Programming Staff.<br>
The Programming Staff was without form and structure.<br>
And the Project Manager said, "Let there be Organization;"<br>
And there was Organization.<br>
And the Project Manager saw that Organization was good;<br>
And the Project Manager separated the workers from the supervisors,<br>
and he called the Supervisors "Management," and he called the workers
"Exempt."

And the Project Manager said, <br>
"Let there be a mission in the midst of the Organization,<br>
and let it separate the workers, one from another."<br>
And the Project Manager created the mission and he called it "The System."<br>
And the Project Manager separated those who were to benefit from The System from those who were to build it.<br>
And he called the former "Users," and he called the latter "Programmers."<br>

And the Project Manager said, "Let all the Programmers in the Organization be gathered together into one place,<br>
and let a Chief Programmer be brought up to lead them."<br>
And it was so.<br>
And the Project Manager saw that he was competent.<br>

And the Project Manager said unto the Chief Programmer, "Create for me a schedule,<br>
so that I may look upon the schedule and know the Due Date."<br>
And the Chief Programmer went among his staff and consulted with them.<br>
And the staff was divided into two parts, one part called "Analysts"<br>
and the other part called "Application Programmers."<br>
And the Analysts went back to their desks and estimated, as was their custom.<br>
And it came to pass that each Analyst brought his estimate to the Chief Programmer, <br>
whereupon he collected them, summarized them,<br>
and drew a PERT CHART.

And the Chief Programmer went unto the Project Manager <br>
And presented unto him the estimate saying, "It shall take ten months."<br>
And the Project Manager was not pleased and said, <br>
"I have brought you up from the depths of Staff; you have not grasped the "Big Picture."<br>

And the Project Manager hired consultants and authorized overtime,<br>
and he said to the Chief Programmer,<br>
"Behold, see all that I have done!  The Due Date will be in FIVE months!"<br>
The Chief Programmer was much impressed and went from before the Project Manager to implement The System.<br>
And the Chief Programmer sent his Analysts to the Users and said,<br>
"Let Specifications be written!"<br>
And there were meetings, and lunches, and telephone calls,<br>
And the Specifications were written,<br>
And there was a Payday and the Happy Hour, one month.<br>

And the Chief Programmer examined the Specifications and saw that they were too ambitious.<br>
And he separated the mandatory features from the optional features;<br>
And he called the mandatory features "Requirements,"<br>
and he called the optional features "Deferred,"<br>
and the Users called him names.<br>
And the Chief Programmer gave the Specifications to the Analysts and said,<br>
"Let the Requirements be analyzed and let the files bedesigned."<br>
And it was so.<br>
And the Chief Programmer said, "Let the Software Houses put forth their Salesmen, <br>
and let us have a Data Management System."<br>
And it was so.<br>
The Software Houses brought forth all manner of Salesmen who presented their packages,<br>
and claimed wondrous things for them,each according to his own file structure.<br>
And it came to pass that a Data Management System was selected;<br>
And the Chief Programmer saw that it was good.<br>
And there was a Payday and the Happy Hour, a second month.<br>

And the Chief Programmer said, "Let the System be divided into parts, <br>
and let each part become a Module.  And let programming<br>
teams be formed and let each be assigned to write a Module."<br>
And it was so.

And the Chief Programmer created the programming teams with two levels,<br>
A greater and a lesser; <br>
And he called the greater the "Senior Programmers" <br>
And he called the lesser the "Junior Programmers."<br>
And he gave the greater dominion over the lesser.<br>
And the Chief Programmer saw it was good.<br>
And the Senior Programmers saw it was good.<br>
And the Junior Programmers saw it differently.<br>
And there was a Payday and the Happy Hour, a third month.<br>

And the Chief Programmer said, <br>
"Let the programming be started and let much overtime be consumed, <br>
for there is but two months left."<br>
And the Programmers, both the greater and the lesser, were much afraid <br>
And they strove to please the Chief Programmer.<br>
And they flowcharted, and they coded, each in his own fashion.<br>
And the Chief Programmer looked upon the work and liked it not.<br>
And the Chief Programmer said, "Let there be a Standard;"<br>
And there was a Standard.<br>
And the Programmers looked upon the Standard and liked it not.<br>
And there was a Payday and the Happy Hour, a fourth month.<br>

And the Chief Programmer said, "Let there be Progress Reports, so we can monitor and control;"<br>
And there were Progress Reports.<br>
And the Chief Programmer looked upon the Progress Reports and saw that the Due Date was not to be met.<br>
And the Chief Programmer arose, bought a suit,<br>
shaved his beard and went unto the Project Manager, and groveled.<br>
And the Chief Programmer pointed his fingers, and caused Blame<br>
to issue forth upon all manner of creatures who sold Hardware and<br>
Software.And the Chief Programmer asked for an Extension.<br>

And the Project Manager was exceedingly angry, and cast doubts<br>
upon the Chief Programmer's ancestry, and did utter a multitude<br>
of threats.  But it came to pass that an Extension was granted;<br>
And the Chief Programmer took the extension back to the programming teams and there was much rejoicing.<br>
And the programming of the Modules was completed.<br>
And there was a Payday and the Happy Hour, the fifth month.

And the Chief Programmer said, "Let the Modules be integrated, one with another, so that System Testing may begin."<br>
And it was so.<br>
Two by two, the Modules were integrated, one with another.<br>
And great difficulties were experienced, and many hours of overtime were used, and many cups of coffee were consumed.<br>
And it came to pass that System Testing was completed.<br>
And there was a Payday and the Happy Hour, the sixth month.

Then the Chief Programmer did go unto the Project Manager,<br>
and said, "Behold, I bring you tidings of great joy which will come<br>
to all Users; for on this day The System is completed."<br>
And suddenly there was with them a multitude of Users praising the Chief Programmer saying,<br>

"Glory be to The System in the highest, but can you make this one small change?"
