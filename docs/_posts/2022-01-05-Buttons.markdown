## What is a Button?
A `Button` is the basic control to allow the user trigger an action in a screen.  JavaFX has two `Button` classes; `Button` and `ToggleButton`.  In this article, we're going to look at the `Button` class itself.

## How Button Fits in the JavaFX Hierarchy

Button inherits methods and properties from these important classes:

Node
: Everything in JavaFX inherits from `Node`, which gives most of its methods for styling, event handling and responding to mouse actions as well as location and transformation.

Control
:  This is the base class for user interaction controls on a screen.  This base class adds skinning, tool-tips and context menus to `Node`.

Region
:  All `Control` classes are `Regions`, which means that they can contain other `Nodes` and have layout properties like padding and borders.

Labeled
:  In JavaFX, the `Label` class contains both a graphical Node and a text property, and the Labeled classes also support this same idea as the contents of the `Control` as a `Region`.

The version 16 JavaDocs for ``Button`` can be found [here](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/javafx.controls/javafx/scene/control/Button.html)

## Layout

You can think of a `Button` as styled `Region` with a background and a border containing a `Label` (which, of course, contains a Graphic and/or some text).  All of the button-like feel of a `Button` is just the styling responding to different states of the properties in the class.  

These states change when:

* The `Button` is disabled.
* Gains or loses focus.
* Becomes or stops being default.
* When the cursor enters or leaves the Region.
* When a mouse button is clicked and released when the cursor is in the region.

Of course, you can change the way that the `Button` responds to all of these changes.


## CSS Elements

### Modena

To understand how the styling works with the properties on `Buttons`, we'll look at the Modena stylesheet, which is the standard stylesheet that ships with the latest versions of JavaFX.

The basic colours in Modena are as follows:

<svg width="120" height="45">
  <g>
   <rect width="120" height="40" style="fill:#ececec;stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
   <text x="10" y="25" fill="black" font-size="14" >-fx-base</text>
  </g>
</svg>
<svg width="120" height="45">
  <g>
    <rect width="120" height="40" style="fill:#ececec;filter: brightness(126%);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
    <text x="10" y="25" fill="black" font-size="14" >-fx-background</text>
  </g>
</svg>
<svg width="120" height="45">
  <g>
    <rect width="120" height="40" style="fill:#ececec;filter: brightness(77%);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
    <text x="10" y="25" fill="black" font-size="14" >-fx-outer-border</text>
  </g>
</svg>
<svg width="120" height="45">
  <g>
    <rect width="120" height="40" style="fill:#ABD8ED;filter: brightness(77%);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
    <text x="10" y="25" fill="black" font-size="14" >-fx-default-button</text>
  </g>
</svg>
<svg width="120" height="45">
  <g>
    <rect width="120" height="40" style="fill:#039ED3;filter: brightness(77%);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
    <text x="10" y="25" fill="black" font-size="14" >-fx-focus-color</text>
  </g>
</svg>

The rest of the colours you see referenced are more complicated gradients and ladders based on these fundamental colours, but this should give you the idea.

It's important to note that -fx-color is initially set be -fx-base.  Most of the transitions are accomplished by changing -fx-color to another value for the `Button`.

Here's what the various stylings look like:

![Button Styles]({{page.buttonStyles}})

The following selectors control `Buttons` in the CSS, these are the definitions from "Modena":

### Base layout for Button

``` css
.button {
  -fx-background-insets: 0 0 -1 0, 0, 1, 2;
  -fx-background-radius: 3px, 3px, 2px, 1px;
  -fx-padding: 0.333333em 0.666667em 0.333333em 0.666667em; /` 4 8 4 8 `/
  -fx-text-fill: -fx-text-base-color;
  -fx-alignment: CENTER;
  -fx-content-display: LEFT;
}
```

The first three lines here create the border and shadow effects by layering 4 background colours on top of each other with differing insets and corner radii.  There's no actual "border" defined. The colours are standard colours for the Modena theme.

The text colour is set to be the standard theme text colour.

### Mouse Hover

This is the styling added when the cursor hovers over the `Button`.  It simply lightens it up a little.

{% highlight css %}
.button:hover {
  -fx-color: -fx-hover-base;
}
{% endhighlight %}

-fx-hover-base is supposed to be just a little bit lighter than -fx-base.

### Armed

When the mouse button is pressed when the cursor is over the `Button` it appears to push down a little bit.  This is accomplished by darkening it a by 6%.  JavaFX refers to this as "armed".

It's virtually impossible to have an armed `Button` that doesn't also have focus.  So the example in the image above shows both states.

{% highlight css %}
.button:armed {
  -fx-color: -fx-pressed-base;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Focused

When the `Button` has focus, the border colour scheme changes to a "glowing" blue ring:

{% highlight css %}
.button:focused {
  -fx-background-color: -fx-focus-color, -fx-inner-border, -fx-body-color, -fx-faint-focus-color, -fx-body-color;
  -fx-background-insets: -0.2, 1, 2, -1.4, 2.6;
  -fx-background-radius: 3, 2, 1, 4, 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Disabled

Disabled `Buttons` are a quite a bit translucent.  Personally, I find this amount to be extreme and it makes the buttons almost difficult to see.

{% highlight css %}
.button:disabled {
  -fx-opacity: 0.4;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Mnemonic Underline

This is specifically the colour of the underline which is shown under key letters when the mnemonics are activated (usually by pressing the \<Alt\> key).  Ordinarily the colour of the underline is "transparent".

{% highlight css %}
.button:show-mnemonics > .mnemonic-underline {
  -fx-stroke: -fx-text-base-color;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Default

When a `Button` has been set as the "default", the base colour changes to a light blue.

{% highlight css %}
.button:default {
  -fx-base: -fx-default-button;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Properties

`Button` has all of the standard properties of `Node` and `Region`, which define things like `MaxHeight`, `MaxWidth`, `Visible`, `Managed` and so on.  In addition, it has a few other properties which are interesting:

Let's take a look at what some of those properties actually do:

### Graphic

Since `Button` extends `Labeled`, it has two properties holding the contents.  The `Graphic` is simply any kind of `Node` that you want to put on the `Button`.  It can be an `ImageView`, an icon, or something bigger and complex, like a `TableView`, `BorderPane`, or `Chart`.  That would probably end up with a really big `Button`, but it would still work.

Here's a sample showing how the Graphic property can be manipulated:

``` java
public class ButtonsGraphicExample extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createView()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createView() {
        HBox results = new HBox(10);
        Button button1 = new Button("", new ImageView(new Image("/images/JavaFXLogo.png")));
        ImageView logo = new ImageView(new Image("/images/JavaFXLogo.png"));
        logo.setFitHeight(32);
        Button button2 = new Button("Click Me!", logo);
        Shape circle1 = createCircle(Color.TEAL);
        Shape circle2 = createCircle(Color.TEAL);
        Shape circle3 = createCircle(Color.RED);
        Button button3 = new Button("Button", circle1);
        Button button4 = new Button("Focused?");
        button4.graphicProperty().bind(Bindings.createObjectBinding(() -> button4.isFocused() ? circle3 : circle2, button4.focusedProperty()));
        results.getChildren().addAll(button1, button2, button3, button4);
        results.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        return results;
    }

    private Shape createCircle(Paint colour) {
        Circle results = new Circle(40);
        results.setFill(colour);
        results.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
        results.setStrokeWidth(2.0);
        return results;
    }

}
```
The first two `Buttons` show an `ImageView` loaded in as the graphic, with and without a `Text` value.  The last two `Buttons` have a `Shape` loaded into the `Graphic`.

The last `Button`, "button4" has its `Graphic` property bound to its `Focused` property, swapping out a red circle when the `Button` has focus.

This is what it looks like with the focus somewhere other than the last `Button`:

![Button Graphics]({{page.buttonUnfocused}})

And when the last `Button` has focus:

![Button Styles]({{page.buttonFocused}})


### Text

The other part of `Labeled` is a `StringProperty` called `Text`, and is simply any text you want to show on the `Button` and is what people generally think of as the `Button` "label".  Since it's a property, it can be bound to other properties in your screen and Model and change dynamically.

Here's an example where the `Text` is bound to the results of an animation loop, so that the `Button` displays the number of seconds (almost) since the `Button` was clicked:

``` java
public class ButtonBoundText extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        HBox pane = new HBox(20, createTimerButton(), createTimerButton());
        pane.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(pane));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    @NotNull
    private Button createTimerButton() {
        Button timerButton = new Button("Timer");
        timerButton.setOnAction(evt -> createTimer(timerButton.textProperty()));
        return timerButton;
    }

    private void createTimer(StringProperty boundProperty) {
        IntegerProperty counter = new SimpleIntegerProperty(0);
        Timeline timeline = new Timeline(new KeyFrame(Duration.seconds(10000), new KeyValue(counter, 10000)));
        boundProperty.bind(Bindings.createStringBinding(() -> Integer.toString(counter.get()), counter));
        timeline.play();
    }
}
```

This is what it looks like with the timer on the second `Button` running:

![Button Text Changing]({{page.timerButtons}})

### DefaultButton

Straight from the JavaDocs for `Button`, as it says it all:

>A default button is the button that receives a keyboard VK_ENTER press, if no other node in the scene consumes it.

This can be super useful if you have a screen with multiple `Buttons` but you want your UI to respond to "Enter" key in an appropriate manner.  Or if you have several data entry controls that need to be completed in order to activate a `Button` to respond to "Enter".

For instance, you can bind the `DefaultButton` property of a `Button` to the `Focused` property of a `TextField`.  So whenever a user hits "Enter" from that `TextField`, it activates the `Button`, but not if they are not in that `TextField`.

## Events

### The OnAction Event

`OnAction` is really the only event you're likely to use with a `Button`.  It's the one that's fired when you click and release the `Button`.

For practical purposes, there's no useful information in event itself, and just the fact that it's been fired is the main piece of information you'll need in order to do anything that's triggered by the event.  My recommendation is to keep the Event Handler itself as short as possible, and create a method to handle the actual work that the `Button` is going to do, possibly passing the `Button` itself as a parameter so that you can access its properties to temporarily disable it.

#### A Simple example

In this example, we're just going to update a `Label` on the screen with contents from a `TextField`.  The entire action of the `Button` is set with just this one line:

``` java
button.setOnAction(evt -> target.setText(textField.getText()));
```

That's pretty simple, but you can see that there's no need to reference any data from the `Event` itself, it's just a trigger for the action to happen.

``` java
public class ButtonActionExample extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createView()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createView() {
        Label actionTarget = new Label("Button Has Not Yet Been Clicked");
        VBox results = new VBox(10, inputLine(actionTarget), new HBox(6, new Label("Results: "), actionTarget));
        results.setPadding(new Insets(20));
        return results;
    }

    private Node inputLine(Label target) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        Button button = new Button("Fetch");
        button.defaultButtonProperty().bind(textField.focusedProperty());
        button.setOnAction(evt -> target.setText(textField.getText()));
        return new HBox(6, new Label("Enter Some Text Here: "), textField, button);
    }
}
```
Before you click on the `Button`, the screen looks like this:

![Before Clicking]({{page.buttonBefore}})

And then it looks like this:

![After Clicking]({{page.buttonAfter}})



## Tips

### Disable vs Disabled Properties

This confuses everyone.  `Disable` is the read/write property that you can change to control whether or not the `Button` is to be disabled.  `Disabled` is a read-only property that will tell you if the `Button` is currently disabled.  `Disabled` should always be used for querying, as it will change if a containing `Node` of the `Button` has been disabled, while querying `Disable` will only tell you if the `Button` has been specifically disabled.

### Avoid Double-Clicks

If a `Button's` action takes more than a couple of milliseconds to complete it's a good idea to immediately set `Disable` to true in the OnAction event so that the user can't trigger it a second or third time while it's running.

This can get a little tricky if `Disable` has been bound to other elements of the GUI.  In that case you should create a boolean property called "xyzRunning" (or something similiar) and add it to your binding.  Then toggle that property instead of directly messing with the `Disable` property.

### Binding the Default Property

Being able to just hit \<Enter\> can be a huge convenience for users, and is often the most intuitive behaviour.  But there might be multiple `Buttons` that could be candidates for the "default", and the correct one might change depending on what's happening in the GUI.  Here's an example where there are two lookup buttons, and the one that is default is determined by which `TextField` has the focus at any given time:

``` java
public class DefaultButtonExample extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createView()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createView() {
        VBox results = new VBox(10, inputLine("Customer Name:"), inputLine("Account Number:"));
        results.setPadding(new Insets(20));
        return results;
    }

    private Node inputLine(String label) {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        Button button = new Button("Fetch");
        button.defaultButtonProperty().bind(textField.focusedProperty());
        return new HBox(6, new Label(label), textField, button);
    }
}
```

This looks like this:

![Default Buttons]({{page.defaultButton}})

It's also easier than trying to capture \<Enter\> in the keystrokes in the `TextField`!


### Use Multiple Buttons - Don't Reconfigure a Single Button

Sometimes you'll have multiple contexts in which a `Button` could operate, and it might need to have different labels and actions depending on the context.  For instance, in a CRUD screen the `Button` could read "Create" for a new record, or "Update" to save an existing record.  Unless the differences are entirely cosmetic, it's usually cleaner to have two or more `Buttons` and simply hide any `Buttons` that don't apply, rather that keeping track of the context and having the OnAction Event Handler figure which action code it should be running.

Here's an example where the `Button` that's shown depends on whether or not a `TextField` has anything entered into it or not.  There are four versions of it on the same screen, to show both states and confirm which action was run when clicked:

``` java
public class ButtonHideExample extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        HBox row1 = new HBox(20, createExample(), createExample());
        HBox row2 = new HBox(20, createExample(), createExample());
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(new VBox(20, row1, row2)));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createExample() {
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        Label targetLabel = new Label("Nothing has been clicked");
        HBox inputRow = new HBox(6, new Label("Number: "), textField);
        HBox outputRow = new HBox(6, new Label("Results:"), targetLabel);
        VBox results = new VBox(10, inputRow, outputRow, createButtons(textField.textProperty(), targetLabel.textProperty()));
        results.setPadding(new Insets(20));
        return results;
    }

    private Node createButtons(StringProperty triggerProperty, StringProperty targetProperty) {
        Button saveButton = new Button("Save");
        saveButton.visibleProperty().bind(triggerProperty.isEmpty().not());
        saveButton.managedProperty().bind(saveButton.visibleProperty());
        saveButton.setOnAction(evt -> targetProperty.set("Save was clicked"));
        Button generateButton = new Button("Generate");
        generateButton.visibleProperty().bind(triggerProperty.isEmpty());
        generateButton.managedProperty().bind(generateButton.visibleProperty());
        generateButton.setOnAction(evt -> targetProperty.set("Generate was clicked"));
        return new StackPane(saveButton, generateButton);
    }
}
```

Which looks like this:

![Hiding Buttons]({{page.hidingButtons}})

Things to note about this:

* You need to set both the `Visible` and `Managed` properties.<br>
  If you don't do this then the invisible `Buttons` will still take up space on the screen.
* There's no connection between the two `Buttons`
* Each `Button` is fully configured in 4 lines of code.
* The `Button` creation method is essentially stand-alone.<br>
  It's given a pair of properties to work with, but there's no global variables or any other connection to the rest of the screen.  In fact, the same method is called 4 times, and the results of each are completely independent.

### Content Drives Minimum Size

If you have large content in your `Button`, the `Button` will grow to accommodate it.  Setting `MaxHeight` or `MaxWidth` won't cause the button to shrink if it's smaller than the size of the contents.  You'll need to apply some sort of scaling transformation on your content to make the `Button` smaller.

However, setting `MinHeight` and `MinWidth` can make a `Button` larger.
