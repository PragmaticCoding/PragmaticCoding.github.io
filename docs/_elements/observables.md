# JavaFX Observables, Bindings and Listeners

Observables, Bindings and Listeners are the key elements supplied by the JavaFX library to create Reactive applications in JavaFX.  This is incredibly complete toolkit, which means that it can also be complicated and difficult to understand.  These articles are designed to explain what each of these elements are, and how you can use them to create simple, easy to understand and maintain Reactive applications.

# Bindings:

`Bindings` are `ObservableValues` that are tied to one or more other `ObservableValues`.  This means that they are automatically updated when any one of those other `ObservableValues` changes.  This allows you to define your application in terms of relationships between dynamic values which is the key to building Reactive applications.
