# JavaFX nodes

There are large amount of classes in JavaFX arranged in a hierarchy starting with a top level class called, `Node`.  There are a number of layout classes that all work differently, such as `BorderPane`, `ScrollPane`, `HBox`, `VBox`, `GridPane` and `StackPane` which can all be embedded inside of each other to create exactly the layout you want.

There are classes to display images, text or text and images together.  `ListView`, `TreeView` and `TableView` allow collections of data to be displayed on screen (and edited) in highly customizable ways.

For user input, you can choose from `TextField`, `ComboBox`, `ChoiceBox`, `Spinner`, `Checkbox`, `RadioButton`, `Buttons` and `ToggleButtons`.

All of these Nodes have a large number of methods and properties for controlling their presentation and how they act.  Learning how to use them and configure them can be a daunting task.  Luckily, most of the tutorials on the web seem to focus on this aspect of JavaFX, so help is easy to find.
