# Miscellaneous Examples and Sample Projects

From time to time I find myself writing little examples of how to do stuff in JavaFX.  Very often this has to do with a question or discussion on Reddit or StackOverflow.

I often end up with a neat little piece of something which isn't going to be the subject of some bigger article or tutorial, but it would be a shame to just lose track of it and not publish it.  This is a home for those little projects.  

All of these projects are going to be found in a single repostory on GitHub, [Examples](https://github.com/PragmaticCoding/Examples).  So you can go there to see the complete code.  Each of these articles will have a direct link to the source code on GitHub.
