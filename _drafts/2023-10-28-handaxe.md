# Introduction

I like to visit archeological museums, and some of the first exhibits I go to in any museum are the really early tools.  Especially cool are the "hand axes".  They look like this:

![Handaxes]({{page.Handaxes1}})

Sometimes, they are a little more tooled, and they look like this:

![Tooled Handaxe]({{page.Handaxes2}})

And sometimes they are are pointy, like this:

![Pointy Handaxe]({{page.Handaxes3}})

They're called "hand axes" because they don't have any handles.  They are just axes that you hold in your hand, and they are a bit better than a rock - but not much.  Hand axes are utility tools, and you can use them to cosh your neighbour on the head and take his stuff, crack open nuts and bones, cut and scrape stuff, or do any number of other things.

Hand axes were generally in use from about 500,000 (0.5mya) and throughout almost all of that time they represented the pinnacle of human engineering achievement.
