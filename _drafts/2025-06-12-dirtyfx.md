# Introduction

As I developed my own approach designing JavaFX layouts, I moved away from "scraping" values out of the various screen `Nodes`, instead binding the `Node` values to independent `Properties` that were also accessed by my application logic.  

But I had one issue with this approach...

{% include notice_question type="primary" content = "How do you know if a value has been changed?" %}

This becomes important if you have a "Save" or "Update" `Button` that you only want to be enabled if there actually is something to save or update.  If the data is in the `Nodes`, you can potentially compare it the value that you initially have, that you loaded into the `Nodes` in the first place.  How do you do this.

One of the programmers on my team found a cool project on GitHub called ["DirtyFX"]({{page.GitHubLink}}), written by Thomas Nield, that solves this problem perfectly.  In fact, at the time, I took the existence of a project like this as validation of my approach since it meant that someone else got to the same place before me.

This was also the first time that I ever saw Kotlin code.  At the time, we were quite mystified by it and unable to make a lot of sense about it.  I didn't look at Kotlin again for another 5 years.
