# Introduction

As I developed my own approach designing JavaFX layouts, I moved away from "scraping" values out of the various screen `Nodes`, instead binding the `Node` values to independent `Properties` that were also accessed by my application logic.  

But I had one issue with this approach...

{% include notice_question type="primary" content = "<br>How do you know if a value has been changed?<br><br>" %}

This becomes important if you have a "Save" or "Update" `Button` that you only want to be enabled if there actually is something to save or update.  If the data is in the `Nodes`, you can potentially compare it the value that you initially have, that you loaded into the `Nodes` in the first place.  How do you do this.

One of the programmers on my team found a cool project on GitHub called ["DirtyFX"]({{page.GitHubLink}}), written by Thomas Nield, that solves this problem perfectly.  In fact, at the time, I took the existence of a project like this as validation of my approach since it meant that someone else got to the same place before me.

This was also the first time that I ever saw Kotlin code.  At the time, we were quite mystified by it and unable to make a lot of sense out of it.  I didn't look at Kotlin again for another 5 years.

# What it Does

DirtyFX is a set of `DirtyProperties` that you can use instead of `SimpleObjectProperty` and all of the other `Simple{Type}Properties`.  They are fully compatible with every other kind of `Property`, so you can use them anywhere that you would use an ordinary `Property`.  

However, `DirtyProperties` have the ability to hold a "baseline" value, and whenever the "current" value of the property is different from that baseline value, that `Property` is considered "dirty".  There are methods that allow you to "lock-in" the baseline value, and to reset the current value back to the baseline value.  

This means that you can tell if a `DirtyProperty` has been changed since the baseline was set.

Additionally, the "dirty" aspect of the `DirtyProperty` is exposed as an `ObservableBooleanValue`, which means that you can create `Listeners` and `Bindings` that are dependent on the "dirtyness" of a `DirtyProperty`.

Finally, there are `CompositeDirtyProperties` that allow you to combine the "dirtyness" of a number of `DirtyProperties` into a single `Property`.

# Using DirtyFX

I'm going to talk about DirtyFX in the context of Reactive programming, where you have a Presentation Model that is a data representation of the "State" of your GUI, and which is bound to the various `Properties` of the `Nodes` in your layout.  This can apply if you are using my MVCI framework, or if you choose to use MVVM.  In either case, you have that data representation of state - the ViewModel in MVVM, and the Model in MVCI.

That Presentation Model is where you are going to implement DirtyFX.  But, just as you would expose regular `Properties` as `{Type}Property` instead of `Simple{Type}Property`, you expose your `Dirty{Type}Property` as `{Type}Property`.  The DirtyFX nature of the elements of the Presentation Model remain hidden from the rest of the framework.

## Example 1

To expose the "Dirty" aspect of your Presentation Model, create `ObservableBooleanValues` that you can bind to the `isDirtyProperty` of the `DirtyProperties`.  More often than not, these are going to be `CompositeDirtyProperties`, which do that binding for you.  Let's look at an example:

``` kotlin
private class PresentationModel() {
    private val _dataChanged = CompositeDirtyProperty()
    val dataChanged: ObservableBooleanValue
        get() = BooleanExpression.booleanExpression(_dataChanged)
    val firstName: StringProperty = DirtyStringProperty("").addTo(_dataChanged)
    val lastName: StringProperty = DirtyStringProperty("").addTo(_dataChanged)
}
```
Here we have two `StringProperties` that are implemented as `DirtyStringProperty` and added to a `CompositeDirtyProperty` called `_dataChanged`.  Then `_dataChanged` is exposed externally as an `ObservableBooleanValue` through `dataChanged`.  Internally, we need to be able to refer to `_dataChanged` as a `CompositeDirtyProperty` in order to use it as an argument to `DirtyProperty.addTo()`.  That's why we have the private `_dataChanged` and public `dataChanged` fields construct.

Let's look at how this is used in the layout:

``` kotlin
class DirtyFXExample1 : Application() {

    private val model = PresentationModel()

    override fun start(stage: Stage) {
        stage.scene = Scene(createContent(), 300.0, 300.0).addWidgetStyles()
        stage.title = "DirtyFX Example 1"
        stage.show()
    }

    private fun createContent(): Region = VBox(10.0).apply {
        children += HBox(10.0, Label("First Name: "), TextField().bindTo(model.firstName))
        children += HBox(10.0, Label("Last Name: "), TextField().bindTo(model.lastName))
        children += Label()
            .bindTo(
                StringExpression.stringExpression(
                    model
                        .dataChanged.map { if (it) "Changed" else "Not changed" })
            ) styleAs LabelStyle.PROMPT
        alignment = Pos.CENTER
    } padWith 20.0

}

fun main() {
    Application.launch(DirtyFXExample1::class.java)
}
```
We have two `TextFields` each bound to one of the two `StringProperties` in the Presentation Model.  Then we have a `Label` with its content bound to the `dataChanged` field in the Presentation Model through a `map{}` that causes it to display either "Changed" or "Not Changed".

At the start, it looks like this:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap0}})

When the "First Name" `TextField` is filled in, it looks like this:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap1}})

And when the "Last Name" `TextField` is filled in, it looks like this:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap2}})

## Example 2

A common use for tracking changes from the baseline is to enable/disable "Save" buttons in the GUI.  So we'll look at this next.

For this example we'll need to modify our Presentation Model a little bit.  We still don't want to expose the DirtyFX nature of our `Observables` to the layout, but we *do* need to be able to call `DirtyProperty.rebaseline()` on them.  We are also going to need some way to simulate a "Save" operation on our screen.

``` kotlin
private class PresentationModel1() {
    private val _dataChanged = CompositeDirtyProperty()
    val dataChanged: ObservableBooleanValue
        get() = BooleanExpression.booleanExpression(_dataChanged)
    private val _firstName = DirtyStringProperty("").addTo(_dataChanged)
    val firstName: StringProperty
        get() = _firstName
    private val _lastName = DirtyStringProperty("").addTo(_dataChanged)
    val lastName: StringProperty
        get() = _lastName
    val savedNames: ObservableList<String> = FXCollections.observableArrayList()

    fun trackSavedData() {
        savedNames += firstName.value + " " + lastName.value
        _firstName.rebaseline()
        _lastName.rebaseline()
    }
}
```
You'll see that we now have the same private/public field pairs so that we can treat those `StringProperties` as `DirtyStringProperties` inside the Presentation Model.  This allow access to `rebaseline()`.

When I first wrote this, I called `trackSavedData()`, `saveData()` and I felt like it was cheating in MVCI.  That's because `saveData()` really should be an Interactor function, but I didn't want add any more distracting structure around the DirtyFX stuff.  But there's an interesting question here.  Wouldn't you want to hide the DirtyFX nature of the fields from the Interactor as well?  Of course you would.

So I changed the name to `trackSavedData()` and I can now see it as being a method that *could* be called from the Interactor after it has completed the save, whatever the "save" entails.  This method only does two things:

1. Creates a String combining the current values of the two `StringProperties` and adds it to `savedNames`.
1. Rebaselines both `DirtyStringProperties`.  This sets the baseline value of the `DirtyProperties` to whatever is in their current value.  It also means that they immediately stop being dirty.

What *still* is a bit of a cheat is that we still aren't going to have an Interactor (or a Controller) and we are going to call `PresentationModel.trackSavedData()` directly from the layout:

``` kotlin
private fun createContent(): Region = HBox(20.0).apply {
    children += VBox(10.0).apply {
        children += HBox(10.0, Label("First Name: "), TextField().bindTo(model.firstName))
        children += HBox(10.0, Label("Last Name: "), TextField().bindTo(model.lastName))
        children += Label()
            .bindTo(
                StringExpression.stringExpression(
                    model
                        .dataChanged.map { if (it) "Changed" else "Not changed" })
            ) styleAs LabelStyle.PROMPT
        children += Button("Save Data").apply {
            setOnAction { evt -> model.trackSavedData() }
            disableProperty().bind(BooleanExpression.booleanExpression(model.dataChanged).not())
        }
        alignment = Pos.CENTER
    }
    children += ListView<String>().apply {
        items = model.savedNames
    }

} padWith 20.0
```
I've changed the root of the layout from a `VBox` to an `HBox` and the old `VBox` is now the first element inside the `HBox`.  Beside it, we have a ListView which is displaying `PresentationModel.savedNames`.

At the bottom of the `VBox`, we now have a `Button`.  When the `Button` is clicked, it calls `PresentationModel.trackSavedData()`.  It is also has its `disableProperty()` bound to `PresentationModel.dataChanged.not()`.  In other words, it is disabled when neither of the two `DirtyStringProperties` are dirty.

When you start up the application, it looks like this:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap3}})

You can see that the `Button` is disabled.  Then, when you fill the `TextFields` in, it looks like this:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap4}})

Now the `Button` is enabled.  After clicking the `Button` it looks like this:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap5}})

You can see that the `Button` is disabled again.  And after some more typing:

![Screen Snap]({{page.ScreenSnap6}})

The `Button` is re-enabled.  

# How DirtyFX Works

Let's take a look at the inner working of DirtyFX, because it there are some interesting ideas.

Central to the library is the interface, `DirtyProperty`:

``` kotlin
interface DirtyProperty {
    fun isDirtyProperty(): ObservableValue<Boolean>
    val isDirty: Boolean
    fun rebaseline()
    fun reset()
}
```
The first two methods allow the client code to check, bind or listen for whether or not the value is dirty.  The last two methods are for resetting either the base or the current value.

Let's look at `DirtyIntegerProperty` to see how it works:

``` kotlin
class DirtyIntegerProperty(initialValue: Int): IntegerProperty(), DirtyProperty{

    private val _originalValueProperty = SimpleIntegerProperty(initialValue)
    private val _isDirtyProperty = SimpleBooleanProperty(false)

    private val delegate = SimpleIntegerProperty(initialValue)

    private val listener = ChangeListener<Number> { _,_,_ ->
        _isDirtyProperty.set(_originalValueProperty.get() != value)
    }

    init {
        addListener(WeakChangeListener(listener))
    }

    fun originalValueProperty(): ObservableIntegerValue = _originalValueProperty
    val originalValue get() = _originalValueProperty.get()

    /** Sets the current value to now be the "original" value **/
    override fun rebaseline() {
        _originalValueProperty.set(value)
        _isDirtyProperty.set(false)
    }
    /** Resets the current value to the "original" value **/
    override fun reset() {
        value = _originalValueProperty.get()
        _isDirtyProperty.set(false)
    }
    override fun isDirtyProperty(): ObservableValue<Boolean> = _isDirtyProperty
    override val isDirty get() = _isDirtyProperty.get()

    override fun getName() = delegate.name

    override fun addListener(listener: ChangeListener<in Number>?) = delegate.addListener(listener)

    override fun addListener(listener: InvalidationListener?) = delegate.addListener(listener)

    override fun removeListener(listener: ChangeListener<in Number>?) = delegate.addListener(listener)

    override fun removeListener(listener: InvalidationListener?) = delegate.removeListener(listener)

    override fun get() =  delegate.get()

    override fun getBean() = delegate.bean

    override fun set(value: Int) = delegate.set(value)

    override fun unbind() = delegate.unbind()

    override fun bind(observable: ObservableValue<out Number>?) = delegate.bind(observable)

    override fun isBound() = delegate.isBound
}
```
First off, we can see that this class extends `IntegerProperty` directly.  This means that it sits beside `SimpleIntegerProperty` in the `Observable` class hierarchy.  It also implements the `DirtyProperty` interface.

This class is essentially a wrapper around two other `IntegerProperties`.  One of the is the "value", called `delegate`; and the other is the "original value", called `_originalValueProperty`.  Both of these are implemented as `SimpleIntegerProperty` fields.

Before we look at the "dirty" stuff, you should note that all of the functions from `IntegerProperty` are implemented here by delegating them to `delegate` - which is why it's probably called "delegate".  This includes things like `get()`, `addListener()`, `bind()` and `unBind()`.

Note that the two methods that are normally implemented in `SimpleIntegerProperty` - `getBean()` and `getName()` are implemented here by delegating to `delegate`.  However, there is no way to instantiate `DirtyIntegerProperty` and set the underlying values for `getName()` and `getBean()` - so they will always return the default values.  This is virtually never going to be an issue.

The only real code that we have in this class is the code that handles the "dirty" aspect of the `Property`.

The methods `rebaseline()` and `reset()` are worth a quick look:

``` kotlin
/** Sets the current value to now be the "original" value **/
override fun rebaseline() {
    _originalValueProperty.set(value)
    _isDirtyProperty.set(false)
}
/** Resets the current value to the "original" value **/
override fun reset() {
    value = _originalValueProperty.get()
    _isDirtyProperty.set(false)
}
```
Interestingly, the getters for the original value aren't included in the `DirtyProperty` interface:

``` kotlin
fun originalValueProperty(): ObservableIntegerValue = _originalValueProperty
val originalValue get() = _originalValueProperty.get()
```
Given how important the "read-only" nature of `_originalValueProperty` is, I probably would have implemented this to return `ReadOnlyIntegerProperty` instead of `ObservableIntegerValue`.  Just to prevent client code from casting it to `IntegerProperty` and writing to it.

The last piece to look at is the "Dirty" tracking aspect.  We have this:

``` kotlin

    private val listener = ChangeListener<Number> { _,_,_ ->
        _isDirtyProperty.set(_originalValueProperty.get() != value)
    }

    init {
        addListener(WeakChangeListener(listener))
    }
```
The idea behind a `WeakChangeListener` is that it won't prevent the target from being garbage collected if it's the *only* holding a reference to the target.  In this case the target is `delegate`.  I'm not an expert on `WeakListeners` and garbage collection, but I'm not sure that this is needed here, as `listener` and `delegate` are both fields in `DirtyIntegerProperty` and would presumably be eligible for garbage collection at the same time.



# DirtyFX is Kotlin, But Not Very Kotliny

The Kotlin crowd has a term that they use *all* the time: "Idiomatic Kotlin".  This is probably because most Kotlin programmers come from Java, and when everyone starts out with Kotlin they end up writing Java code in Kotlin.  Eventually, you learn to do things in the Kotlin way or, if you like, idiomatic Kotlin.  

DirtyFX still looks quite a bit like Java code written in Kotlin.  

More than anything else, I was bothered by the large amount of boilerplate repeated across vitually every class.  It's this stuff (from `DirtyIntegerProperty`):

``` kotlin
override fun getName() = delegate.name

override fun addListener(listener: ChangeListener<in Number>?) = delegate.addListener(listener)

override fun addListener(listener: InvalidationListener?) = delegate.addListener(listener)

override fun removeListener(listener: ChangeListener<in Number>?) = delegate.addListener(listener)

override fun removeListener(listener: InvalidationListener?) = delegate.removeListener(listener)

override fun get() =  delegate.get()

override fun getBean() = delegate.bean

override fun set(value: Int) = delegate.set(value)

override fun unbind() = delegate.unbind()

override fun bind(observable: ObservableValue<out Number>?) = delegate.bind(observable)

override fun isBound() = delegate.isBound
```
It doesn't do anything.  It just delegates stuff to the underlying `SimpleIntegerProperty`.  

{% include notice_question type="primary" content = "<br>And about that SimpleIntegerProperty...do we need it?<br><br>" %}

I'm not going to get into a big review of the `Observables` hierarchy here, but `SimpleIntegerProperty` is a direct subclass of `IntegerPropertyBase` and only implements the two required methods (`getName()` and `getBean()`) that are not implemented in `IntegerPropertyBase`.  It also contains constructors and default values to allow `name` and `bean` to be populated when `SimpleIntegerProperty` is instantiated.

If you are going to handle those two functions yourself, there is no benefit to involving `SimpleIntegerProperty` at all!

Even more, `SimpleIntegerProperty` has no methods to handle the actual value, and its constructors that take an initial value just call the constructor of `IntegerPropertyBase` to pass it on.  

In any event, all this boilerplate is very much **not** a Kotlin approach.  

## An Alternative Approach

I decided to incorporate re-tooled versions of the DirtyFX classes into my own WidgetsFX project.  Here's what I did...

In Kotlin interfaces, you can also specify fields - but you cannot initialize them.  You can, however, refer to them in defualt methods in that interface.

I came up with this:

``` kotlin
interface DirtyProperty<T> {

    val base: DirtyPropertyBase<T>

    fun isDirtyProperty(): ObservableValue<Boolean> = base.isDirtyProperty()
    val isDirty: Boolean
        get() = isDirtyProperty().value

    fun rebase() = base.rebase()
    fun reset() = base.reset()
    fun baseValueProperty(): ObservableValue<T> = base.baseValueProperty()
}
```
We have one defined field here, `base` which is of type `DirtyPropertyBase`.  We'll look at `DirtyPropertyBase` next.  

All of the methods in the interface have default methods supplied.  They all delegate to `base`.  Any implementation of `DirtyProperty` **has** to provide an implementation of `base`.

``` kotlin
open class DirtyPropertyBase<T>(private val wrapper: Property<T>) {

    private var baseValue: ObjectProperty<T> = SimpleObjectProperty(wrapper.value)
    private val isDirty: ObservableBooleanValue =
        Bindings.createBooleanBinding({ wrapper.value != baseValue.value }, wrapper, baseValue)

    fun rebase() {
        baseValue.value = wrapper.value
    }

    fun reset() {
        wrapper.value = baseValue.value
    }

    fun isDirtyProperty(): ObservableValue<Boolean> = isDirty
    fun isDirty(): Boolean = isDirty.value
    fun baseValueProperty(): ObservableValue<T> = baseValue
}
```
You can see that `DirtyPropertyBase<T>` takes a `Property<T>` as a constructor parameter field called `wrapper`.  This, `wrapper` is the actual `DirtyProperty` that the application creates and interacts with.  So `base` in `DirtyProperty` holds a reference to whatever it is the "base" for.  This means that `DirtyPropertyBase` can access methods and fields inside its enclosing object.

The baseline value is implemented as a `SimpleObjectProperty<T>` and initialized to the same as the `wrapper` initial value.

Now, `rebase()` and `reset()` just involve copying values between `wrapper` and `base`.  The `isDirty` field is implemented internally as a `Binding` that compares the `wrapper` value to the `base` value.

I also thought that `rebaseline()` was not a verb, so I changed it to `rebase()`.

Let's look at how this all goes together in `DirtyIntegerProperty`:

``` kotlin
class DirtyIntegerProperty(private val bean: Any?, private val name: String, initialValue: Int? = null) :
    IntegerPropertyBase(), DirtyProperty<Int> {
    override fun getName() = name
    override fun getBean() = bean
    override val base = DirtyPropertyBase(this.asObject())

    init {
        initialValue?.let { super.setValue(it) }
        rebase()
    }

    constructor() : this(null, "", null)
    constructor(initialValue: Int) : this(null, "", initialValue)
}
```
Not much here!

The first thing that you should notice is that this is a complete replacement for `SimpleIntegerProperty`.  It suuports the same constructors as `SimpleIntegerProperty` and allows you to initialize `bean` and `name`.  That stuff is also about half the code in here, too.

None of the interface default methods are overridden, but `base` is instantiated.  The only other code here is the `init{}` block which calls `IntegerPropertyBase.setValue()` if the constructor value isn't `null`.  It also performs a `rebase` to ensure that the `Property` does not start out dirty.

I think this is about the minimum amount of boilerplate that you can get away with.  

The one big technical difference between Thomas Nield's original implementation and mine is that he manually tracks the changes via a `WeakChangeListener` and I use a `Binding`.  I checked, and `Binding` through a couple of steps ends up using `WeakReference`, while `WeakChangeListener` also ends up using `WeakReference`.  As far as I can tell, there's no potential garbage collection difference between these two methods.
