# Introduction

One issue that seems to come up quite often is connecting pieces of your application through JavaFX

# State vs Events

Being very, very, very general - and not even directly related to JavaFX - there are two approaches to connecting changes between applications or parts of an application.  One is to track things that happen, Events, and the other is to connect through State.  

Also being very, very general - and still not directly related to JavaFX - it's usually safer to connect via State.

Why?

Because Events are, by their nature, ephemeral.  They happen and they are gone, and if you don't capture them when they happen you're just out of luck.  All Events need some sort of communication structure, or bus, to travel on, and every system that needs to track Events needs to be connected to that bus at the time that the Events happen or they won't be aware of the Events.

On the other hand, State can be checked at any time and it will always give the correct answer.  This means that a system (or subsystem) can query another system about State at the time that it needs the data an get the current answer.  This is independent of whether changes to that State had triggered an Event, or whether that Event is still sitting on a bus waiting to be captured, or even if there are many Events sitting on the bus related to this data.  

For JavaFX programmers, the good news is that JavaFX provides an amazing "State Machine" with all the features that you need to connect parts of your application via State.

## Let's Get One "Issue" Out of the Way

Yes, JavaFX is essentially "Event Driven", and "State" is just an illusion.  

Deep, deep "under-the-hood", JavaFX is using Event methodology to provide the actions that enable a State Machine.  Look down far enough and you'll find `InvalidationListeners` running everything State related.

But, it's probably safe to assume that the core JavaFX libraries are robust, well designed and thoroughly tested and can be treated as essentially foolproof.  We can ignore the underlying Event Driven nature of JavaFX and treat its State features as State - and think of them that way.

# "State" in JavaFX = Bindings

When we think about connecting things via "State" in JavaFX, that almost exclusively means employing `Bindings` as the mechanism.  There are some edge cases that the standard binding tools cannot handle, and in those cases it may be necessary to use a `Listener`.  But, for the most part, we're talking about `Bindings`.

When you bind a `Property` to another `ObservableValue`, JavaFX will initialize the bound property to the same value as that of the `ObservableProperty` it's been bound to, and from that point on it will remain synchronized.  No matter what.  You can count on this.

Properties are all over the JavaFX `Node` classes.  `Labels`, `Texts` and `TextFields` all have `TextProperty` which holds the value that's displayed on the screen.  Many of the other input controls have a `ValueProperty` which serves a similar function.  `Regions` have `HeightProperty`, `WidthProperty`, `MinHeightProperty`, `MaxWidthProperty` and `PaddingProperty` amongst many others.  These all control how these `Nodes` are displayed.  

And it goes on.  Any subclass of `Pane` has `Children`, which is an `ObservableList` of all of the `Nodes` directly contained inside of it.  `TableView` and `ListView` have `Items`, which is an `ObservableList` of the data displayed in them.

All of these `Properties` and `ObservableLists` that aren't read-only can be bound to other `Properties` in your Presentation Model or in other `Nodes`.  The read-only `Properties` can be bound from by `Properties` in your Presentation Model or other `Nodes`.  

## All of Your JavaFX Data Should be Encapsulated in Observables

In order to leverage all of these `Properties` in the JavaFX `Nodes`, you need to wrap all of the data in your Presentation Model inside `Properties`, `ObservableValues` and `ObservableLists`.  When you've done this, you can connect these elements of your Presentation Model to the GUI through bindings.  Now your Presentation Model truly becomes a data representation of the "State" of your GUI.  You can read it from outside the GUI, and you can alter it from outside the GUI to change the GUI - without knowing about the GUI implementation.


# Listeners Convert State Changes to Actions

There are times when it is necessary to perform an action in response to a change in State.  This is what Listeners are primarily intended to do.  

## Listeners Don't Launch Event Handlers

Consider the following code:

``` kotlin
val test = SimpleStringProperty("abc")
test.addListener { observable, oldValue, newValue ->
   println("Old value was: $oldValue, New value is:  $newValue")
}
println("Before the change")
test.value = "XYZ"
println("After the change")
```
Which will generate the following output:
```
Before the change
Old value was: abc, New value is: XYZ
After the change
```
If the code inside the ChangeListener was to be run as an EventHandler, submitted to the FXAT, then we would expect to see the following output:

```
Before the change
After the change
Old value was: abc, New value is: XYZ
```
What this means is that ChangeListener runs in-line with the code that invokes it.  This holds for Bindings as well.  

# EventHandlers Trigger Actions
