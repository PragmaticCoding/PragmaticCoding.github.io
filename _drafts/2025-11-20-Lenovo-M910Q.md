excerpt: "A look at the Lenovo M910Q Tiny computers I've chosen as homelab servers."

# Introduction

When I initiated this project to build a homelab, I didn't want a huge up-front expense.  But I did have a need for whatever I built to be as reliable as possible.  After all, I'm planning on replacing a fair number of cloud services - services that are generally pretty reliable - with home-hosted alternatives.

To me, this means redundancy.

I've looked at lots of photos of people's homelab setups and good number of them, probably even the majority of them, seem to have one server doing most of the work.  This is, of course, a single point of failure.  In my book, that's just not something that you do.

Proxmox is a great help here.  You can set up a cluster of hosts, designate vital containers and VM's, and then have them fail over to different hosts when their host fails.  

But, how do you create a high-availability cluster of servers on a shoestring budget without turning your paycheck over to the electic company?

## 1 Litre PC's

It wasn't long after I started thinking about building a homelab that I started seeing videos, posts, and articles about "mini" PC's that people were using.  These were tiny little desktop computers that idled at about 7W and could handle a surprising amount of load.  

It turns out that there are three basic product lines.  HP has an EliteDesk series that they call "Mini", Dell has an Optiplex line called "Micro" and Lenovo has a ThinkCentre line called "Tiny".  I'm not going to say that they are the same, but, they are all pretty close.  These are all what are called "1 Litre" form factor PC's, and they all use external power bricks instead of internal power supplies.  

Here's what the Lenovo version looks like, with a pen so that you can see the scale:

![M910Q]({{page.M910Q}})

You can see that it's pretty darned small.

These units were incredibly popular with corporate clients.  They bought gazillions of these things because they just worked well for office applications, they were sturdy, and they were cheap.  A lot of them were leased.  

And when those leases ended...

![M910 Stack]({{page.Stack}})

The leasing companies sold them off in bulk at wholesale prices to recover some of the value, and the companies that bought them have refurbished them and are reselling them.  The result is that they are readily available at reasonable prices.  

I was told that the advent of Windows 11 has cause a shortage of these units, and the prices have gone up a fair bit.  Even so, they are still a great value.  

## Why Lenovo

In truth, you probably cannot go wrong with either of the three brands.  These computers were all designed for the same, commercial, market and they are all executed well.  In my area, I was seeing a lot of Dells and Lenovos available, but not so many HPs.  I went with Lenovo because they seemed just a little bit more solid, and there was a bit more variety in the models available.

One thing I really wanted to do have all of the units in the cluster as similar as possible.  I wanted them to be fungible.  As I was planning to purchase them over time, I needed the supply to be consistent over time.

You should also know that these computers, although different, newer models, are still manufactured today and available to purchase new.  

# The Hardware

Let's take a look at these boxes and see what you get.

These have been in production for quite some time.  You'll be able to find models like the M73Q which have 4th gen Intel Core processors for peanuts, but those are probably not going to have enough computing power to be useful.  I decided on the Lenove M910Q which has 6th or 7th generation Core processors.

## M910Q vs M710Q

If you look into these, you'll see that there are two models which look and seem to be very, very similiar; the M910Q and the M710.  What's the difference?

You can see for yourself the spec-sheets:

[M910 Specs]({{page.M910Q_Specs}})

[M710 Specs]({{page.M710Q_Specs}})

As far as I can tell, these two units are nearly the same, except that the M910Q uses the Intel Q270 chipset instead of the B250 chipset in the M710Q.  This means that the M910Q supports VPRO, while the M710Q does not.

Both models support the same set of processors and memory.

The place where I bought mine made no distinction between the M710Q and the M910Q because the average customer wasn't building homelabs.  What they cared about was CPU.  The 7th gen Core i7 cost about double the 6th gen Core i5 models. The price of a system with the same CPU was the identical between the M710Q and the M910Q.  

## The Processors

The M910Q will take a variety of Intel laptop CPU's from the 6th and 7th generations.  It will support Core i3, i5 and i7 processors from both generations.  Let's take a look at the differences.

The i5-7500T is about 10% faster than the the i5-6500T for multithreaded applications, and 8% faster for single-core applications.  Both support 4 cores and 4 threads.  You see the slightly smaller differences between the i7-6700T and the i7-7700T.  

Of course the i7-6700T supports 8 threads, but the i7-6700T is just 16% faster than the i5-6500T for single-core performance.  Multi-threaded performance is significantly higher.  

The biggest difference is between the i5-6500T and the i7-7700T.  Even here, the scores for Cinebench Single-Core come in at 132cb vs 168cb, while Cinebench Mulit-core is 464cb v 805cb.  This last comparison is the biggest of all.

I'm not saying these performance differences are insignificant, but a Core i5-6500T goes for about $50 CAD on eBay, while a Core i7-7700T from the same seller goes for $120 CAD, with the Core i7-6700 at about $100 CAD.  I was seeing this difference in the prices of the M910Q's in the store as well.

## Memory

The M910Q takes DDR4 laptop style, non-ECC SODIMM's.  

## A Look Inside

One of the cool things about the M910Q is that it just needs a single screw on the outside removed in order to gain access to the inside, and most maintenance thereafter is tooless.  The top cover slips off, and then this allows a plate on the bottom to also be removed.  

Let's look at the view of the inside from the top:

![M910Q Inside Top]({{page.M910_Inside_Top}})

The CPU is socketted, and hidden away under the duct extending back from the fan.  From the videos I've seen, I believe that you might need to undo some screws to remove the heat sink and access the CPU socket.

The black plastic construct to the right is the SATA drive cage.  Squeeze that semi-circular plastic bar towards the cage and the whole thing pops out.  The ribbon cable for the drive is held onto the cage with that yellow tape.  On mine, it was zip-tied - which I think is the standard.  

The cage will accept a 2.5" drive with a height of 7mm.

Underneath it is an M.2 slot for a WiFi card, or something compatible with it.  Some models come with the WiFi card and the antenna.

Pull off the plate on the bottom, and this is what you'll see:

![M910Q Inside Bottom]({{page.M910_Inside_Bottom}})

Don't be fooled by the text on the PCB that says, "SATA/NVMU/SSD2".  It's unpopulated on the M910Q and the M710Q.  I believe that the M920Q and the M720Q might have that slot.  In this picture, we have an SSD installed in slot #1.  

The only other thing here is slots for the memory.  

That's pretty much it. There are a small number of options that might be installed in these.  Mine have two DB9 serial ports, but others have additional DisplayPort ports.  Presumably, you could swap these out, but the choices are fairly limited.  

From what I have seen, some of the later HP EliteDesk Mini's have a optional 2.5GB adapter on a daughterboard that can just be slotted in.  But there's nothing like that on the Lenovo's.

# Limitations

Without a doubt, the biggest limitation of these systems, if you are going to use them as Proxmox hosts, is that they only have a single 1GB Ethernet adapters.  There's no upgrade potential here that doesn't involve soldering and 3D printing.

This means that Ceph is probably a no-go.

# Pricing

This is where these little units really shine.  The price.

The outfit I bought my units from was selling them with a standard configuration of 8GB RAM and a 256GB M.2 SSD.  The ones I ended up with had DB9 serial connectors, but no WiFi.  

The basic model with a 6th gen i5 was $100, while the i7 (not sure of the generation) was close to $200.  I did end up with one 7th gen i5, and that was $110, the other two were 6th gen i5 processors. I increased the memory in all of them to 16GB, because I strongly suspected that 8GB wasn't going to cut it for Proxmox servers.  When I bought the first two, I simply bought an extra 16GB DIMM and them moved one of the 8GB DIMMs to the other system.  For the third one, I just paid to swap out the 8GB DIMM for a 16GB one.

This is going to make upgrading them to 32GB a bit more expensive, because I'll have to by 4 16GB DIMMs and hope I can trade in the two 8GB DIMMS.  

With the memory upgrade, I paid about $115 CAD each for the first two, and then about $145 CAD for the third.  So, about $375 CAD together.  They came with a six month warranty.

## Value Compared to Raspberry Pi's

I checked, and a RPi 5 with 4GB RAM goes for about $105 CAD.  The performance of the RPi is significantly lower than that of the Core i5-6500T, especially when it comes to multi-core performance, where the RPi scores about 60% of that of the i5-6500T.  

It's almost certain that the M910Q draws more power than the RPi 5, especially when idle.  So if you do have an application that needs fairly low single-core processing power which is idle for most of the time, an RPi might be a more appropriate solution.  Also, if you do have a need for the GPIO capabilities of the RPi, then it's clearly the way to go.
