excerpt: If you are going to do any custom styling in JavaFX, you need to understand at least the basics about the Modena stylesheet and how it works with the standard JavaFX Nodes.
---

# Introduction

If you use JavaFX, then you are almost certainly using the Modena stylesheet - or a custom stylesheet designed to work with the standard JavaFX `Node` subclasses in much the same way that Modena does.

Unfortunately, Modena is big.  Like... 3,440 lines big.  And it can seem very complicated because it uses a lot of advanced and subtle techniques that aren't obvious if you're not a CSS guru.  

This article is about understanding Modena, and how it interacts with the standard JavaFX `Nodes`.  The intention is that once you've read this article, you should be able to look at the styling of just about any of those `Nodes` on the screen, and then find the right places in Modena that make it look way and understand how it does it.  

You aren't going to see any specific methods for handling any specific `Node` classes here.  This article is all about giving you the tools to be able to figure that for yourself, which is far more valuable.

# The Components of JavaFX Styling

In JavaFX there are four basic elements that are used to create styling for a `Node` subclass.

1. StyleableProperties<br>These are the base units of styling in JavaFX.  Every `StyleableProperty` has a connection back to a stylesheet attribute and provides the mechanism to turn that stylesheet attribute setting into something visual in the GUI.
1. CSS Selectors<br>Stylesheets are broken down into sections that are identified via a name called a "Selector".  JavaFX `Nodes` contain a list of CSS selectors that will be applied, in order, to provide values for the various `StyleableProperties` defined for the `Node`.  When `Node` subclasses inherit from their parent `Nodes` they can either start a brand new list of selectors, or add new values to the inherited list.
1. Pseudoclasses<br>`PseudoClasses` are used to provide selectors that are applied to a `Node` on a temporary basis.  Each `PseudoClass` is a `Boolean` value that is associated with a CSS selector.  When the `PseudoClass` value is `true`, then the selector is applied to the `Node` and then removed when it changes to `false`.
1. StyleSheets<br>Stylesheets contain all of the specifications of how the `StyleableProperties` will be applied to various `Nodes` in the GUI.  Multiple stylesheets can be added at the `Stage`, `Scene` or root `Node` level of a window and they will be applied in the order in which they are listed.

In this article we are going to concentrate on the last item in this list, the stylesheet.  Specifically, we are going to look at the [Modena]({{page.Modena}}) stylesheet, which is the default stylesheet that has shipped with JavaFX for quite a few years.  

## Modena is Integrated with the JavaFX Library

While it is easy enough to say, "We're going to look at the Modena stylesheet", in truth you cannot study it in isolation.  Take a look at this snippet:

``` css
.web-view .form-select-button {
    -fx-background-radius: 2, 2, 1, 0;
    -fx-background-insets: 2 2 1 2, 2, 3, 4;
}
```
To understand what this does you need to understand what the selector ".web-view .form-select-button" means.  This is defined somewhere in the JavaFX source code, probably in the skin for the `WebView` control.  In the same way, the meanings of "-fx-background-radius" and "-fx-background-insets" are defined as `StyleableProperties` somewhere in the class hierarchy leading to `WebView`, probably in `Region`.

It should be clear at this point that Modena and the JavaFX classes are closely integrated, and you cannot understand Modena without understanding how the various `Node` classes work and are interelated.  One of the biggest challenges is when a `Control` is actually composed of a number of different `Controls` - and this happens a **lot** in JavaFX.  Just look at the example above, we can infer that `WebView` is composed of a number of different elements, one of which is a `Button` that is related to some function identified as "form select".  

Applying your own custom styling to a `Node` is generally going to involve adding a CSS selector in your own stylesheet for that `Node`, and then defining values for the various attributes that apply to that `Node` class, or its superclasses.

## Getting a Copy of Modena

I would strongly suggest that you download a copy of Modena and save it somewhere on your system where you can get at it easily for future reference.  It used to be easiest to just extract it from whatever JFX jar you had downloaded to use in your projects.  Nowadays, using Maven or Gradle the associated plugin will download OpenJFX is the background and you don't have to go through the process of grabbing the jar for yourself.  You can still pull Modena out of your IDE, however, if you know where to look.

Once you've compiled a JavaFX project at least once with Gradle or Maven, you should have a section in your project called "External Libraries".  Somewhere in that section you'll have a bunch of OpenJFX items.  You're looking for the one that is called "org.openjfx:javafx-controls:{O/S}:{version}".  For me this is "org.openjfx:javafx-controls:linux:23".

Inside that library, you are looking for the following path: `com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.modena.modena.css`.  And that's the file.  You can just open it in your IDE, or you can copy it somewhere that makes it easier for you.

You can get a copy directly from the GitHub project for [OpenJFX](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx23u/blob/master/modules/javafx.controls/src/main/resources/com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css) is the link for the JFX 23 version.

## The Reference Guide

The last thing that you'll need is the CSS Reference Guide for JavaFX.  This is available as a web page.  For JFX 23, it can be found here:

[https://openjfx.io/javadoc/23/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/23/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html)

You should bookmark this, you'll need it a lot.  

# The Colours

A large part of understanding Modena boils down to understanding how it deals with colours.  Modena does a **lot** of hocus-pocus with colours and huge amounts of the definitions are about defining and applying various colours.

## Base Colours

In reality, Modena has very few colours defined as simple colours.  Virtually all of the colours are derived from a handful of base colours, and you can completely change the colour scheme of your application just by redefining some of those colours.  Let's take a look at them, these are all defined in the `.root` section:

``` css
-fx-base: #;

/* A very light grey used for the background of windows.  See also
 * -fx-text-background-color, which should be used as the -fx-text-fill
 * value for text painted on top of backgrounds colored with -fx-background.
 */
-fx-background: derive(-fx-base,26.4%);

/* Used for the inside of text boxes, password boxes, lists, trees, and
 * tables.  See also -fx-text-inner-color, which should be used as the
 * -fx-text-fill value for text painted on top of backgrounds colored
 * with -fx-control-inner-background.
 */
-fx-control-inner-background: derive(-fx-base,80%);


-fx-dark-text-color: black;
-fx-mid-text-color: #333;
-fx-light-text-color: white;

-fx-accent: #0096C9;

-fx-default-button: #ABD8ED;

-fx-focus-color: #039ED3;
-fx-faint-focus-color: #039ED322;

/* The color that is used in styling controls. The default value is based
 * on -fx-base, but is changed by pseudoclasses to change the base color.
 * For example, the "hover" pseudoclass will typically set -fx-color to
 * -fx-hover-base (see below) and the "armed" pseudoclass will typically
 * set -fx-color to -fx-pressed-base.
 */
-fx-color: -fx-base;
-fx-background-color: -fx-background;
```
I've left the comments in because they are useful.  Here are the main colours:

<div style="width:120px;height:50px;background-color: #ABD8ED;">-fx-default-button</div>
<div style="width:120px;height:50px;background-color: #ececec;">-fx-base</div>
<div style="width:120px;height:50px;background-color: #0096C9;">-fx-accent</div>
<div style="width:120px;height:50px;background-color: #039ED3;">-fx-focus-color</div>
<br>
This is, as you can see, the familiar blue and gray theme that you see in most JavaFX applications.  

![Screen Snap 0]({{page.ScreenSnap0}})

You can change it by adding the following stylesheet to your application:

``` css
.root {
  -fx-default-button: #EE8434;
  -fx-focus-color: #C95D63;
  -fx-faint-focus-color: #C95D6322;
}
```
And it will look like this:

![Screen Snap 1]({{page.ScreenSnap1}})

There's a lot of other colour definitions in the `.root` section, but they virtually all involve values derived from the handful listed above.  For instance:

``` css
/* A little lighter than -fx-base and used as the -fx-color for the
 * "hovered" pseudoclass state.
 */
-fx-hover-base: ladder(
    -fx-base,
    derive(-fx-base,20%) 20%,
    derive(-fx-base,30%) 35%,
    derive(-fx-base,40%) 50%
 );
```
or:
``` css
/* A little darker than -fx-color and used to draw boxes around objects such
 * as progress bars, scroll bars, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.
 */
-fx-box-border: ladder(
    -fx-color,
    black 20%,
    derive(-fx-color,-15%) 30%
);

/* Darker than -fx-background and used to draw boxes around text boxes and
 * password boxes.
 */
-fx-text-box-border: ladder(
    -fx-background,
    black 10%,
    derive(-fx-background, -15%) 30%
);
```
You get the idea.

You will also see a lot of uses of `derive`, `gradient` and `ladder` in Modena.  You will need to become comfortable with these concepts in order to understand how Modena works.

## Redefining Colours

One "trick" that you'll see quite often in Modena is contextual redefinition of one of the named colours.  This most often happens in Pseudo-class selectors like this:

``` css
.button:hover {
    -fx-color: -fx-hover-base;
}
```
What this means is that for a `Button`, when it has the `hover` Pseudo-class applied, the value of `-fx-color` will be changed to be whatever color `-fx-hover-base` has been defined as.  As you'll see in the next section `Button` has 4 background colours.  Let's look at one of them:

``` css
-fx-body-color: linear-gradient(to bottom,
        ladder(
            -fx-color,
            derive(-fx-color,8%) 75%,
            derive(-fx-color,10%) 80%
        ),
        derive(-fx-color,-8%));
```
You can see how changing `-fx-color` will change the definition of `-fx-body-color`, and this will change the look of the `Button` when the mouse is hovering over it.  

Sometimes a `Node` will retain most of its inherited styling, but just change the definition of a colour:

``` css
.list-cell,
.tree-cell {
    -fx-background: -fx-control-inner-background;
    -fx-background-color: -fx-background;
    -fx-text-fill: -fx-text-background-color;
}
```
Remember that this colour change will also hold for any sub-components of the `Node`.  In this case, since `ListCell` is a subclass of `Labeled`, there will be a `graphic` and a `text` element.  

Sometimes you see this redefinition used inside a sub-component of another `Node`:

``` css
.combo-box > .list-cell {
    -fx-background: transparent;
    -fx-background-color: transparent;
    -fx-text-fill: -fx-text-base-color;
    -fx-padding: 0.333333em 0.666667em 0.333333em 0.666667em; /* 4 8 4 8 */
}
```
Here we see the `-fx-background` redefined from its previous redefinition when it is the the `ListCell` in the main part of a `ComboBox`.

# Default Styling

If you look at the styling for `list-cell` in the section above, you'll see that there isn't much there.  Where does the rest of the styling come from?

The hierarchy to get to `ListCell` is this`Node` -> `Parent` -> `Region` -> `Control` -> `Labeled` -> `Cell` -> `IndexedCell` -> `ListCell`.  Not all of these classes have CSS selectors specified, `Node`, `Parent`, `Region`, `Control` and `Labeled` do not.  While there are selectors for `ListCell`, as we've seen, there are no selectors in Modena for `IndexedCell` or `Cell`, although there are selectors for sub-components and Pseudo-classes of `Cell`.

So where does the default styling come from?

The answer is to look at `Region` where you'll find this:

``` java
private static class StyleableProperties {
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Insets> PADDING;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Insets> OPAQUE_INSETS;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Background> BACKGROUND;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Border> BORDER;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Shape> SHAPE;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Boolean> SCALE_SHAPE;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Boolean> POSITION_SHAPE;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Boolean> CACHE_SHAPE;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Boolean> SNAP_TO_PIXEL;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Number> MIN_HEIGHT;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Number> PREF_HEIGHT;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Number> MAX_HEIGHT;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Number> MIN_WIDTH;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Number> PREF_WIDTH;
    private static final CssMetaData<Region, Number> MAX_WIDTH;
    private static final List<CssMetaData<? extends Styleable, ?>> STYLEABLES;

    private StyleableProperties() {
    }

    static {
        PADDING = new CssMetaData<Region, Insets>("-fx-padding", InsetsConverter.getInstance(), Insets.EMPTY) {
            public boolean isSettable(Region var1) {
                return var1.padding == null || !var1.padding.isBound();
            }

            public StyleableProperty<Insets> getStyleableProperty(Region var1) {
                return (StyleableProperty)var1.paddingProperty();
            }
        };
        .
        .
        .
        MAX_WIDTH = new CssMetaData<Region, Number>("-fx-max-width", SizeConverter.getInstance(), -1.0) {
            public boolean isSettable(Region var1) {
                return var1.maxWidth == null || !var1.maxWidth.isBound();
            }

            public StyleableProperty<Number> getStyleableProperty(Region var1) {
                return (StyleableProperty)var1.maxWidthProperty();
            }
        };
    }
}
```
This is where the default values are established, in the code, and they will be passed to sub-classes through inheritance.  There are even more defined in `Node`, and presumably any class in the hierachy can inject its own styleable properties into the structure.  You don't have to look into the code to find the values, though, the [CSS Reference Guide](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/23/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#region) for `Region` has all this information.  

# Enclosed Components

It is important to understand that the standard JavaFX `Nodes` that are composed of other `Nodes`, especially the ones with skins, don't have any special qualities when it comes to the stylesheets.  Any `Region` that you use in a layout to hold child `Nodes`, even nested layout classes, will interact with the stylesheet in exactly the same way.

CSS has two ways to specify compound selectors (which refer to `Nodes` which are children of other `Nodes`).  The first is `.`:

``` css
.slider .thumb {
    -fx-background-color:
        linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-text-box-border, -20%), derive(-fx-text-box-border, -30%)),
        -fx-inner-border,
        -fx-body-color;
    -fx-background-insets: 0, 1, 2;
    -fx-background-radius: 1.0em; /* makes sure this remains circular */
    -fx-padding: 0.583333em;  /* 7 */
    -fx-effect: dropshadow(two-pass-box , rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 5, 0.0 , 0, 2);
}
```
and the second is `> .`:
``` css
.tool-bar > .container > .separator {
    -fx-orientation: vertical;
}
```
The first form refers to any occurance of the second selector in any of the children, or the children of children, of the first selector.  The second form refers only to occurances of the second selector in **direct** children of the first selector.  You'll find many more usages of the second form in Modena than you will of the first form.

Here's an example of how this works:

``` kotlin
class ModenaExample1 : Application() {
    override fun start(stage: Stage) {
        stage.scene = Scene(createContent(), 300.0, 240.0).apply {
            ModenaExample1::class.java.getResource("example1.css")?.toString()?.let { stylesheets += it }
        }
        stage.show()
    }

    private fun createContent(): Region = VBox(10.0).apply {
        styleClass += "nest-outer"
        children += Button("Outside")
        children += VBox(10.0).apply {
            styleClass += "nest-middle"
            children += Button("Middle")
            children += VBox(10.0).apply {
                styleClass += "nest-inner"
                children += Button("Inside")
            }
        }
    }
}

fun main() = Application.launch(ModenaExample1::class.java)
```
This is just a set of nested `VBoxes`, each having a single `Button` in them.  Here's the stylesheet:

``` css
.nest-outer {
  -fx-background : blanchedalmond;
  -fx-padding: 20px;
  -fx-border-color: green;
  -fx-border-width: 3px;
  -fx-body-color: coral;
}

.nest-middle {
  -fx-border-color: blue;
  -fx-border-width: 3px;
  -fx-padding: 20px;
}

.nest-inner {
  -fx-border-color: red;
  -fx-border-width: 3px;
  -fx-padding: 20px;
}

.nest-middle .button {
  -fx-body-color: thistle;
}

.nest-middle > .button {
  -fx-body-color: aqua;
}
```
Each of the `VBoxes` has a different coloured border, so that you can see where they are, and the outermost `VBox` with the selector, `nest-outer`, redefines `-fx-body-color` which is the innermost colour in the background for `Button`.  It looks like this:

![Screen Snap 3]({{page.ScreenSnap3}})

First, you can see that the redefinition of `-fx-background` holds for all of the elements inside of the `nest-outer VBox` because all three `VBoxes` have that same colour.  

The last two selectors in the stylesheet redefine `-fx-body-color` for `Buttons` inside of the `nest-middle VBox`.  The first one redefines it for *every* `Button` inside `nest-middle` and the second, the `> .` selector, redefines it for `Buttons` directly contained inside `nest-middle`.  The order of the selectors inside the stylesheet is important, and if we reverse these two last selectors we get this:

![Screen Snap 4]({{page.ScreenSnap4}})

This is becasue the more general selector would supercede the more specific `> .` selector because it came second.

# Modena Doesn't Use Borders!

Let's look at the styling for (amongst other things) `Button`:

``` css
.button {
    -fx-background-color: -fx-shadow-highlight-color, -fx-outer-border, -fx-inner-border, -fx-body-color;
    -fx-background-insets: 0 0 -1 0, 0, 1, 2;
    -fx-background-radius: 3px, 3px, 2px, 1px;
    -fx-padding: 0.333333em 0.666667em 0.333333em 0.666667em; /* 4 8 4 8 */
    -fx-text-fill: -fx-text-base-color;
    -fx-alignment: CENTER;
    -fx-content-display: LEFT;
}
```
Here we have 4 different backgrounds defined.  The are applied in order, each successive background going on top of the previous backgrounds.  However, the backgrounds on the bottom are all a little bit bigger than the ones that follow, at least in some dimension.  This is defined by the insets.

Let's look at how this works...

The background on the bottom is `-fx-shadow-highlight-color` and its insets are 0 except for the bottom, which is -1.  This means that this background will exactly match the size of the `Button` on the top, left and right, but extend 1px down below the bottom of the `Button`.

The next background is `-fx-outer-border` and it has insets of 0 (or 0,0,0,0), which means that it will exactly match the size of the `Button`.  This will cover up all of the first background, excepty for that strip of 1px at the bottom where it sticks out below the `Button`.  This is hard to see with the normal palette on a white background, but if we change `-fx-shadow-highlight-color` to `red` in our custom colour stylesheet, it's quite clear:

![Screen Snap 2]({{page.ScreenSnap2}})

The third background is `-fx-inner-border` and it has insets of 1.  This will leave a 1px wide strip all around the edge of the `Button` where the second background is visible.

Finally, the last background is `-fx-body-color` and it has insets of 2.  This will be the colour that you see for most of `Button` and it will leave a 1px wide ring of the third background visible just inside the dimensions of the `Button`.

Essentially, we have a "border" made up of three different colours - at least on the bottom - and then a background of `-fx-body-color`.  It makes the `Button` look three dimensional.  

This is the technique that you will see used over, and over in Modena. It's actually very rare to see a real border used in Modena.  The attribute `-fx-border-width` is set only 7 times in the entire file, and `-fx-border-color` is set to something non-transparent only 15 times.  

So borders are used in Modena, it's just that most of them are composed of stacked backgrounds, and then a tiny handful are actual borders as defined in the JavaFX library.

# The Standard PseudoClasses

In order to understand Modena, you'll need to know about the various Pseudo-classes that are used.  These are defined in the JavaFX source code for the various nodes, but you will seem them referenced in Modena, and many are available but not used in Modena itself.  You can, however, use them in your own style sheets to customize based on Modena.

All `Node` subclasses support the following Pseudo-classes:

* disabled
* focused
* focus-visible
* focus-within
* hover
* pressed
* show-mnemomonic

Various other `Node` subclasses support some of these common Pseudo-classes:

* armed
* cancel
* default
* selected
* determinate
* indeterminate
* empty
* filled
* editable
* showing
* vertical
* horizontal

And then there are a number of Pseudo-classes with a very specific scope.  All of these are documented in the [JavaFX CSS Reference Guide](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/23/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html).

Here's an example of how Modena commonly implements Pseudo-classes:

``` css
.toggle-button:selected {
        -fx-background-color:
            -fx-shadow-highlight-color,
            linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-outer-border, -20%), -fx-outer-border),
            linear-gradient(to bottom,
                    derive(-fx-color, -22%) 0%,
                    derive(-fx-color, -13%) 20%,
                    derive(-fx-color, -11%) 50%);
    -fx-background-insets: 0 0 -1 0, 0, 1;
}
```
This is the `selected` Pseudo-class for a `ToggleButton`.  You can see that it's mostly a colour change, which isn't surprising.  This definition sets the background colour and insets.  

You can see that there are three different background colours stacked on top of each other to create a three dimensional "border" in a manner similar to what we saw with `Button`.  And that's all this Pseudo-class does, changes the background and border so that it looks "selected".

You will also see Pseudo-classes stacked quite often:
``` css
.toggle-button:selected:focused {
    -fx-background-color:
        -fx-focus-color,
        linear-gradient(to bottom,
            derive(-fx-color, -22%) 0%,
            derive(-fx-color, -13%) 20%,
            derive(-fx-color, -11%) 50%),
        -fx-faint-focus-color,
        linear-gradient(to bottom,
            derive(-fx-color, -22%) 0%,
            derive(-fx-color, -13%) 20%,
            derive(-fx-color, -11%) 50%);
    -fx-background-insets: -0.2, 1, -1.4, 2.6;
    -fx-background-radius: 3, 2, 4, 0;
}
```
This is the selector for a `ToggleButton` that is both "selected" and "focused".

# Shared Definitions

When multiple selectors have the same settings, Modena will combine them into a single entry using "," to separate the selectors.  For instance, the selector that defines `Button` is

``` css
.button,
.toggle-button,
.radio-button > .radio,
.check-box > .box,
.menu-button,
.choice-box,
.color-picker.split-button > .color-picker-label,
.combo-box-base,
.combo-box-base:editable > .arrow-button {
  .
  .
  .
}
```
This means that if you want to change the styling of `Button` you're going to have to decide if you really just mean `Button` or everything that is "button-like".  Otherwise, your application could take on an inconsistent look.

# Compound Nodes

There are a large number of `Node` classes that are actually composed of multiple internal `Nodes`.  Each of these internal components can have their own CSS selectors and be styled individually.  

Many times you can spot these in Modena.  Here's `CheckBox`:

``` css
.check-box {
    -fx-label-padding: 0.0em 0.0em 0.0em 0.416667em; /* 0 0 0 5 */
    -fx-text-fill: -fx-text-background-color;
}
.check-box > .box {
    -fx-background-radius: 3, 2, 1;
    -fx-padding: 0.166667em 0.166667em 0.25em 0.25em; /* 2 2 3 3 */
}
.check-box > .box > .mark {
    -fx-background-color: null;
    -fx-padding: 0.416667em 0.416667em 0.5em 0.5em; /* 5 5 6 6 */
    -fx-shape: "M-0.25,6.083c0.843-0.758,4.583,4.833,5.75,4.833S14.5-1.5,15.917-0.917c1.292,0.532-8.75,17.083-10.5,17.083C3,16.167-1.083,6.833-0.25,6.083z";
}
```
But how do we know that this is all of the internal components that might be styled?  Just as there's no requirement that all of the Pseudo-classes for each `Node` are styled in Modena, it's possible that internal components are defined that are just left at their default styling.  

To find out definitively, we will need to check the source code for the `Node`.  Let's do that for `CheckBox`...

If we put a call to `CheckBox()` in an application, then we can click through and see the decompiled code for `CheckBox`.  From there we can do a search for "getStyleClass", which has to be called to add a CSS selector to the class.

``` java
private void initialize() {
    this.getStyleClass().setAll(new String[]{"check-box"});
    this.setAccessibleRole(AccessibleRole.CHECK_BOX);
    this.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER_LEFT);
    this.setMnemonicParsing(true);
    this.pseudoClassStateChanged(PSEUDO_CLASS_DETERMINATE, true);
}
```
The first thing we can see is that all of the `StyleClasses` that might have been inherited from any superclasses are cleaned out via the `setAll()` method.  And the `CheckBox` overall is assigned the selector of `check-box`.  There are no other calls to `getStyleClass()` in the class.  This means that any other CSS selectors have to be assigned in the skin.

We need to find where the skin is created.  Searching in the code for "skin" gives this:

``` java
protected Skin<?> createDefaultSkin() {
     return new CheckBoxSkin(this);
 }
```
If we click-through into this we'll come to the constructor for `CheckBoxSkin` which gives is this:
``` java
public CheckBoxSkin(CheckBox var1) {
    super(var1);
    this.behavior = new ButtonBehavior(var1);
    this.box.getStyleClass().setAll(new String[]{"box"});
    this.innerbox = new StackPane();
    this.innerbox.getStyleClass().setAll(new String[]{"mark"});
    this.innerbox.setNodeOrientation(NodeOrientation.LEFT_TO_RIGHT);
    this.box.getChildren().add(this.innerbox);
    this.updateChildren();
}
```
And a search for "getStyleClass" only yields two hits, which are both in this constructor method.  So the only selectors are the ones that we saw used in Modena at the top of this section.  This means that we can completely style `CheckBox` with these three selectors.

We can also now find out two very valuable pieces of information - the types of `box` and `mark`.  This is important because this will tell us what styling attributes are available to us to customize.  

Right above that constructor are these two lines:

``` java
private final StackPane box = new StackPane();
private StackPane innerbox;
```
Now we know that both of these are `StackPanes`.  We could have guessed that they were some kind of `Region` from the CSS in Modena, but now we know exactly what they are.  

## Exploring Via Node.lookupAll()

If looking through the source code seems daunting, there is another method you can try.  `Node` has a method called `lookupAll()` which will accept wildcard characters.  This means that you can call `Node.lookupAll("*")` to find all of the styleclass selectors that are present in a compound `Control`.  It works like this:

``` kotlin
class ModenaExample0 : Application() {
    override fun start(stage: Stage) {
        stage.scene = Scene(createContent())
        stage.show()
    }

    private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
        val checkBox = CheckBox().apply {
            styleClass += "fred"
        }
        center = HBox(10.0).apply {
            children += Button("Button").apply {
                isDefaultButton = false
                onAction = EventHandler {
                    checkBox.lookupAll("*").forEach {
                        println("Id: ${it.id}\tStyleClass: ${it.styleClass}\t\tType: ${it::class.java.simpleName}")
                    }
                }
            }
            children += checkBox
        }
        padding = Insets(30.0)
    }
}

fun main() = Application.launch(ModenaExample0::class.java)
```
You need to run `Node.lookupAll()` after the SceneGraph has been displayed.  That's why it has been implemented inside the `onAction EventHandler` for a `Button`.  When you click on the `Button`, this is what you get:

```
Id: null   StyleClass: check-box fred    Type: CheckBox
Id: null   StyleClass: text              Type: LabeledText
Id: null   StyleClass: box               Type: StackPane
Id: null   StyleClass: mark              Type: StackPane
```
We see `check-box`, `box` and `mark`, as well as `fred` that I explicitly added to the `CheckBox` to see how it would show in the listing.  We get to see all of the selectors added to each `Node`, which is good.

But what's this `text`??? We can see that it's a `LabeledText`, but where did it come from?

If we go back to the skin of `ComboBox`, we see that it extends `LabeledSkinBase`.  If we look at `LabeledSkinBase` and search for usages of `LabeledText` we find it right away at the top of the class:

``` java
public abstract class LabeledSkinBase<C extends Labeled> extends SkinBase<C> {
    LabeledText text;
    .
    .
    .
}
```
But you won't find any place where it is assigned a styleclass selector.  However, if you look at the source code for `LabeledText` you will find it assigns itself the selector `text`, and this just stays when it's part of `CheckBoxSkin`.

If you want to know everything that you might style in a JavaFX `Control`, especially one with a skin, then it looks like the best place to start is with a test program like this that uses `Node.lookupAll("*")` to find all of the components that stylesheet selectors.  However, this won't show you how the various components are related to each other, and how they are used.  For that, you'll have to look at the source code.

All that being said, for `CheckBox` the elements are pretty clear.  The `text` element is obviously the text beside the checkbox, and the mark is the checkmark that goes inside the checkbox.  Other skinned `Controls` could be much more complicated.  

# Customizing Modena Selectors

I see lots and lots of example programs, especially when people are asking questions on StackOverflow, where they'll employ a custom style sheet that uses one of the standard `Node` selectors.  Like `button` or `check-box`.  This is fine in a small sample program, but isn't necessarily the best approach with a bigger application with multiple screens.  

There's two potential issues with this.  

The first is that you are changing the styling of *every* `Node` of that type, everywhere.  Is this really what you want to do?  OK, the Modena styling isn't exactly exciting, but it is consistent and it does look professional.  Change the styling of one element without thinking about how it will integrate everywhere with everything else might look a bit odd.  

The second is that many of the stylings work together.  If you go back and look at the styling for `button`, you can see that it is shared with 9 other selectors, some of which are enclosed in other `Nodes`.  Do you want to just change `Button`?  Or should you change all of selectors that share that same styling?  I rarely see people do that.  Additionally, you should also look for places that depend on the original styling, like Pseudo-classes and enclosed `Nodes`.  

Essentially, you are coupling your styling change all over your application.  That's a good thing when you want to restyle the whole application to give it an entirely different feel, but it can be a problem if you've made a change for a specific use case and it impacts seemingly unrelated parts of your GUI.

The alternative is to create a new selector and then perform `styleClass += "{new selector}"` on the `Node`.  Now you are just styling a particular instance of that `Node` type, and you won't have any global issues.  If you are adding this new styleclass selector to a whole bunch of instances of the `Node` then create a builder method to instantiate the `Node` with the selector added.

# Conclusion

My biggest complaint about the JavaFX documentation is that there is no "Styling Guide" that details **all** of the styleclass selectors and nested components of the standard JavaFX `Nodes`.  It would make life so much easier to be able to simply look up the documentation for a skin class and see what they've put there for you to customize.  Instead, you'll have to pour over the source code, search through Modena and figure out how make it work.  

However, once you're comfortable with the techniques used in Modena it is fairly easy to understand how the styling that you see on screen (for most `Nodes`) is achieved through the stylesheet.  Hopefully, this article has given you the tools to understand these techniques.
